Nicehash was a cryptocurrency mining service and marketplace, allowing users to buy and sell their own mining power. While not necessarily a mining pool of its own, it still maintained a wallet for customer funds. Nicehash appears to have shuttered their website with a notice saying "a security breach involving NiceHash website" and "our payment system was compromised and the contents of the NiceHash Bitcoin wallet have been stolen".

A [Facebook livestream](https://www.facebook.com/NiceHash/videos/2013146182237851/) has further notes on the issue. This is hard to archive so I will transcribe useful points. Overall, this was lateral movement from a remote IP address, gaining access to a VPN, possibly through an employee computer, and moving laterally into production systems. This appeared to all have happened within a couple of hours, when the attacker decided to work actively.

1. "We became a target and someone really wanted to bring us down."
2. "We are cooperating with local and international law enforcement".
3. ~4700 BTC stolen on early morning 12-06-2017
4. Can't discuss everything due to investigation.
5. Hacker(s) were able to *infiltrate our internal systems through a compromised company computer*.
5. Unknown how company computer was compromised.
6. *VPN had visibility into abusive behavior*, IP address was outside of European Union.
7. "Made a crucial VPN login using *an engineer's credentials*"
8. After VPN login, *learned and simulated the workings of our payment system*.
9. Managed to steal funds from accounts (indicates that the *active attack timeline was only a couple hours*)
